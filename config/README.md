## Config

This is easily the least interesting part of the entire project. It just loads
the config file found in the root directory.

I'm a huge fan of the library used to do this (https://github.com/spf13/viper)
and I essentially use it in every Go project. However, at this current
iteration (0.1.x), I am not making full use of it. I would like to add support
for environmental variables in the future, and will do so.
