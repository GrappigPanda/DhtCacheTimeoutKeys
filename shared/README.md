Mostly what's kept here are generic pieces of code re-used in several places.
I know this sounds like every other folder, but it's mainly reserved for simple
pieces of code which don't need to act on their own.

A good example of this is the min binary heap implementation which is used for
both the LRU cache and for key expiration.
